## Repository Structure 📂

- `Questions.pdf`: Contains all the problem statements.
- `solutions/`: Folder containing the solutions to the problems in `.cpp` files.

## How to Use 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computational-physics-solutions.git
   cd computational-physics-solutions
2.	Browse the solutions/ folder for the C++ codes.
3.	Compile any solution using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
    ```bash
    g++ solutions/1.cpp -o 1
    ./1
